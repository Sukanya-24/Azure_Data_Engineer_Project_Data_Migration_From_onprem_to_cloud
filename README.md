# End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline from an on-premises PostgreSQL database to Azure Synapse Analytics, following the Bronze-Silver-Gold data lake architecture. It includes data migration, transformation, data governance, and final analytics-ready data in Azure Synapse.
In this project, I used the following Azure services to implement a secure and robust ETL pipeline:

- **Onprem Postrgre SQL Database**
- **Azure Data Factory**
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**
- **Azure Key Vault**
- **Databricks (with Spark)**
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**
- **Power-BI**
- **Programming Languages (SQL,Python,Pyspark)**
